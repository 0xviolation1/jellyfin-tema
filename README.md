# Jellyflix - Another Jellyfin client

Jellyflix is a cross platform Jellyfin Client for Desktop (Mac, Windows, Linux) and Mobile (iOS, Android). It aims to be a simple to use and reliable Jellyfin client for video content. It supports downloads (coming soon).

## Download

Supported platforms:
- iOS (Build it yourself)
- [Android](https://github.com/jdk-21/jellyflix/releases/latest/download/jellyflix.apk)
- macOS (Build it yourself)
- [Windows](https://github.com/jdk-21/jellyflix/releases/latest/download/jellyflix-windows.zip) (untested)

I plan on releasing Jellyflix on the App Stores and Play Store in the future, when the app is stable enough.
